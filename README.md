# YieldCurveBot

This automated Twitter bot posts three factoids:

- A red line representing present day's US Treasury yield curve from 1MO - 30YR.
- A green line representing the closest resembling historical yield curve. 
    - i.e. April 4, 2000
- Number of days from the historical green line to the closest recession. 
    - i.e. Recession of 2001 was ~300 days away from April 4, 2000
